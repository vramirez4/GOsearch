Rscripts for querying gene ontology databases and identifying gene ontology IDs, relevant genes, and their coordinates using keywords

This is a simple set of R functions for retreiving genes involved in a particular process. The tool takes in user supplied keyword queries such as "taste" or "olfaction" and returns a list of Gene Ontology IDs. The GO IDs and biological processes can be inspected by the user.

The GO IDs are used to query the Ensembl database and a list of genes, their coordinates, and other relevant information is returned to the user.
